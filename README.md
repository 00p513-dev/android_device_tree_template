# LineageOS Source Device Tree Template

Start your Android career here. Build device trees and port custom ROMs and recoveries to new devices easily with this template.

Study the templates included to understand how these files work, and then extract a boot or recovery image from your device, and run the mkvendor.sh script to get started! There is information everywhere on the internet on how to set up Android build environments, e.g. on XDA-Developers.

Last of all, have fun! Do some wonderful things with AOSP :) Who knows where it'll lead (only you!)


Personally, I started [here](https://developerswork.github.io/works/GUIDES/AndrodDeviceTree/#). Be warned that this is an *old tutorial*, so when doing this, be sure to cross-reference information shown in the tutorial with the templates here (they are new as of August 2017), or other trees in the LineageOS device repositories. Maybe we can encourage @DevelopersWork to update his tutorial :wink:
